# Student-Management-System
The Student Management System is a C program designed to manage student information efficiently. It provides a range of functionalities to handle various student-related operations, leveraging fundamental programming concepts and data structures. This project demonstrates practical use of conditions, loops, strings, structs, pointers, and linked lists.

## Features

#### 1 . Add a Student: Prompts the user for new student details (ID, name, age, GPA) and adds them to the system.
#### 2 .Display All Students: Shows a list of all stored student records.
#### 3 .Search for a Student by ID: Allows the user to find a specific student using their unique ID.
#### 4 .Update Student Information: Facilitates the updating of details for an existing student identified by their ID.
#### 5 .Delete a Student: Removes a student's record based on their ID.
#### 6 .Calculate Average GPA: Computes and displays the average GPA of all students.
#### 7 .Find Student with Highest GPA: Identifies and displays the student with the highest GPA.
#### 8 .Exit: Terminates the program.

## Implementation Details

### The system uses a linked list to store and manage student records. Each function interacts with this list to perform the required operations, ensuring efficient management of dynamic data.

#### 1 . Add a Student
##### Prompts the user for new student details and adds them to the system by creating a new node and appending it to the linked list.

#### 2 . Display All Students
##### Traverses the linked list and prints out the details of each student stored in the system.

#### 3 . Search for a Student by ID
##### Iterates through the linked list to find and display the details of the student with the specified ID.

#### 4 . Update Student Information
##### Finds the student by ID and allows the user to update their details directly in the linked list.

#### 5 . Delete a Student
##### Removes the student node with the specified ID from the linked list and frees the associated memory.

#### 6 . Calculate Average GPA
##### Traverses the linked list to calculate the average GPA of all students and displays the result.

#### 7 . Find Student with Highest GPA
##### Iterates through the linked list to find and display the student with the highest GPA.
